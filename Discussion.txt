SYSC4001 ASSIGNMENT DISCUSSION

Author: Zakaria Ismail - 101143497

----Discussion of test results-----

There were two tests done. They both computed 
the expected determinant and largest value.

The time to execute was not consistent and varied
between 1500 and 3000 miroseconds. This is because
this program is not the only process running on my
computer; there are other processes for which the CPU
has to share process execution time.

The time to compute is relatively slow because there
are print statements, which is computationally slow.


----DESCRIPTION OF GOALS OF DESIGN----
    - Compute determinant of 3x3 matrix using 3 child processes.
    - Init shared memory
    - Use semaphores to ensure that child processes don't access
    shared memory simultaneously
    - Use signal to wait until all children are killed to end function
    - Use functions appropiately for a modular and readable design


    Design:
    1. Create shared memory
    2. Initialize shared memory
    3. Fork 3 chid processes
    4. Attach shared memory to all processes
    5. Compute determinant portion for all processes
    6. Use semaphore to control loading of data to shared memory
    7a. Let the parent WAIT until its children are killed before displaying
        and returning the result (EDIT: waits until all child processes are killed)
    7b. The child processes will detach from shared memory and then send
        and then kill itself
    8. The parent will save and print the result
    9. The parent will detach and delete shared memory
    10. The parent will return the result
